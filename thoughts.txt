	It *seems* I've gotten liveness calculation working. (The papers I got the algorithms from didn't really have
	many examples, so I'm not entirely sure whether my implementation is correct.) Now I need to do register
	allocation.
	In l6.pdf:11, I think "multiple reaching definitions" refers to phi instructions. Say you have this code:
		; <label>:39:    ; preds = %33
		%40 = load ...
		br label %43

		; <label>:41:    ; preds = %33
		%42 = load ...
		br label %43

		; <label>:43:    ; preds = %41, %39
		%44 = phi i8* [ %40, %39 ], [ %42, %41 ]
	I think this means that %40, %42 and %44 would all be merged into the same equivalence class. The way to deal
	with phi functions is by simply making sure the source variables use the same register, and putting them into
	one equivalence class would accomplish this.
