# <a name="intro"></a>Net Extension

This extension provides trap operations allowing applications to communicate via sockets. For now, the C VM will implement TCP over IPv4. In the future, the JS VM might implement WebSockets support and the C VM might implement UDP support.

Only one connection is allowed at a time.
